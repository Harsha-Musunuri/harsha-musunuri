### Hallo, I am Harsha ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Harsha-Musunuri/harsha-musunuri** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Machine Learning engineer. I believe Machine Learning coupled with traditional software products and solutions can impact millions of lives across the planet. I love spending my free time understanding recent advancements in ML and occasionally, making acoustic covers for my YouTube Channel [Harsha Musunuri](https://www.youtube.com/HarshaMusunuri).

I have 3.5 years of experience in software industry (Java, Python, React, SQL) at Citigroup.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in Rutgers Machine Learning Lab (RUML) advised by Prof.Sungjin Ahn.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to bridge my understanding in Scaling/Deploying ML applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always happy to collaborate on Deep Learning Frameworks on Object Detection and Reinforcement Learning. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Markov Chains, Variational Bayesian, Monte Carlo methods, SVD, Reinforcment Learning, Computer Vision and NLP. 
<!-- - ðŸ˜… Fun facts: I once spent 16 hours playing Watch Dogs by Ubisoft & I once had an experience of buying an invalid train ticket but no cash in hand and the inspector can take only cash (We have friends for a reason :P) -->
