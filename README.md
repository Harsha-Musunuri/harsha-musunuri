### Hallo, I am Harsha ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer. I was born in a small town called Khammam in India. I love spending my free time understanding recent advancements in ML and occasionally, making acoustic covers for my YouTube Channel [Harsha Musunuri](https://www.youtube.com/HarshaMusunuri).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in Rutgers Machine Learning Lab (RUML) advised by Prof.Sungjin Ahn.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to bridge my understanding in Deploying ML applications to production that can impact millions of lives.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always happy to collaborate on Deep Learning Frameworks on Object Detection and Reinforcement Learning. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Bayesian Statistics, Markov Chains, Variational Bayesian, Monte Carlo methods, SVD, Reinforcment Learning, Recommender Systems. 
- ðŸ˜… Fun facts: I once spent 16 hours playing Watch Dogs by Ubisoft & I once had an experience of "about to be fined" moment for an invalid train ticket but no cash in hand and the inspector can take only cash (We have friends for a reason :P)
